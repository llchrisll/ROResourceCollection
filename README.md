# Welcome to a Official Sprite Collection
This repository is only used to make searching for official items easier from certain servers.

It contains extracted and decoded .lub files from official RO Servers.
A pre-packed GRF with sprite and texture files from each server can be found here below.

As of 11th April 2023, I took the time and revamped my way of merging GRF's (took me 2 days).
I will only provide one GRF (official_data.grf), which contains every missing sprite/texture file based on kRO GRF:

### Missing Sprite Files
As I'm still missing entries in the itemInfo_EN.lua file, there might still be a lot missing.   
Also I was unable to add the following items, because I didn't find any sprites for it in any of my sources or there were no ```identifiedResourceName``` in the iteminfo.lua or id2numresnametable.txt file:
| ID  | Item Name | File Name 
| --- | --- | --- 
| 2361 | Blue Robe | ```파란아오자이``` 
| 2362 | Red Robe | ```빨간아오자이``` 
| 2363 | White Robe | ```하얀아오자이```
| 2792 | Ring of Flame Lord | ```플레임로드링```
| 2793 | Ring of Resonance | ```레조넌스링```
| 5689 | Queen Ants Crown | ```개미여왕의왕관```
| 6410 | Kartu Leberan | ```이둘피트리카드```
| 7915 | Bronze Coin | ```코퍼코인```
| 7916 | Silver Coin | ```실버코인```
| 11010 | Catalogue
| 14674 | Cup of Boza | ```보자의컵```
| 22519 | Freeze Buff
| 22520 | Anti-Freeze Buff
| 22624 | Riesen Bretzel |```리젠브리첼```
| 1000682 | Tuner | - 

In case you have any of those above, please pm on me on discord with the files.
